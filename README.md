# Data Analysis Portfolio

by Henry Yu 

This repository contains files for data analysis in Python as well as projects and source code. The majority of the analysis is conducted using the Jupyter notebook in Python, with pandas, scikit learn and numPy. 

The majority of these files are exercises from various websites. These include the Udacity Data Analysis nanocourse, the Google Python tutorials, Kaggle challenges, Youtube tutorials, and Khan Academy tutorial files. 

Each of the folders will correspond to the topic of the files within.
